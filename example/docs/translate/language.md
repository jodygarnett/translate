# Language

To help manage a multi-language build is it kind to provide human translators with an example document to start from.

## Setup

The ``mkdocs-static-i18n <https://ultrabug.github.io/mkdocs-static-i18n/>`` plugin is setup based on suffix, with **`index.md`** is the default English, and **``index.fr.md``** used for French:

    | index.md
    | index.fr.md
    + img/
      | figure.png
      + figure.fr.png

The configuration of `mkdocs-static-i18n` is represented in **`mkdocs.yml`** using:

``` yaml
plugins:
  - i18n:
      docs_structure: suffix
      reconfigure_material: true
      languages:
        - locale: en
          default: true
          name: English
        - locale: fr
          name: Fran√ßais
          site_name: 'Aide en ligne'
          nav_translations:
            Home: Accueil
            Search: Recherche
```

## Language Translation {: #translate }

Translation uses ***pandoc*** to convert to `ml`, and then using [Deepl REST API](https://deepl.com).

1.  Provide environmental variable with Deepl authentication key:

    ``` bash
    export DEEPL_AUTH="xxxxxxxx-xxx-...-xxxxx:fx"
    ```

2.  Translate a document to french using pandoc and deepl:

    ``` bash
    mkdocs_translate french docs/help/index.md
    ```

3.  To translate several documents in a folder:

    ``` bash
    mkdocs_translate french docs/overview/*.md
    ```

4.  See `mkdocs_translate french --help` for more options.

### Limitations

Keep in mind the following limitations:

-   Deepl charges by the character so bulk translation not advisable.
-   You are welcome to use google translate, ChatGPT, or Deepl directly - keeping in mind markdown formatting may be lost.
-   Please see the [writing guide](../guide/markdown.md) for what ***mkdocs*** functionality is supported.

Specific ***pandoc*** extensions are used to match the capabilities of ***mkdocs***:

| markdown extension   | pandoc extension     |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| tables pymdownx.keys | pipe_tables          |
| pymdownx.superfences | backtick_code_blocks |
| admonition           | fenced_divs          |

The differences differences in markdown requires pre/post processing of markdown and html files. These steps are automated in the ***mkddoc_translate***, supporting additional***mkdocs*** features requires updating this script.
