# Writing Guide

Working with documentation, markdown formatting, and writing style guide.

-   [Markdown](markdown.md)
-   [Style Guide](style.md)

!!! note

    The ***mkdoc_translate*** script can adapt some markdown extensions for use with ***pandoc*** conversion, but not everything.
    
    While it is fine to use the ***mkdoc_translate*** script for initial [Content Migration](../translate/migrate.md#migrate), if you wish to continue using this tool for [language translation](../translate/language.md#translate) you are advised to keep the following writing guidelines in mind.

!!! abstract "Material for MkDocs"

    The writing guide is setup for use with the excellent [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).
    
    This is a great project that was selected by the GeoNetwork community (primarily for the visual appeal). In practice it ends up being quite a nice way to "keep up" with advances in the mkdocs ecosystem without having to constantly research what is best.
